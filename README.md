A ToDoList with an “index.php” page allowing any user to create an account and connect to it. Once logged in, the site user is redirected to a “todolist.php” page.
This page contains:
- A list of tasks to do, accompanied by their creation date, with a button to specify that a task has been completed or canceled.
This task is removed from the list.

- A list of completed tasks where each task is accompanied by the date it was completed.
- An input allowing to create a task.
- A disconnect button.

With the exception of the logout button, all possible actions on the “todolist.php” page are 'asynchronous'.
